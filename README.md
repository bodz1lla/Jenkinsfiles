# Jenkinsfiles

Jenkinsfiles, using a domain specific language based on the Groovy programming language, are persistent files that model delivery pipelines “as code”, containing the complete set of encoded steps (steps, nodes, and stages) necessary to define the entire application life-cycle. 

Jenkinsfile consists of three stages: Build, Test, and Deploy.

This is going to be a collection of Jenkinsfile examples.

## Usage

1. Download Jenkinsfile and change environment variables.
2. Upload Jenkinsfile in your repository.
3. Add repo to Jenkins Build Job.
4. Enable Jenkinsfile. 
5. Build and enjoy the proccess! :)
